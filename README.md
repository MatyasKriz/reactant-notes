# RNotes
###### Keep all your important notes in one place. Then wipe them all!
<br>
This project shows off the **Reactant** architecture. This time creating a beautiful note taking application that saves your notes as long as you don't accidentally press the inconvenient `Wipe` button in the `NavigationBar`.

    It looks something like this:<br><br>
    <img src="RNotesPreview.png" alt="Simulator screen 1" width="350" />
</p>

    Modifying notes also works like a charm!<br><br>

Deleting single notes is not implemented, a PR would be greatly appreciated!
